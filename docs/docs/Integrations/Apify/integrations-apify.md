- Extracting data from Google Maps
- Insert into a PostgreSQL/MySQL/MSSQL database
- Running various other automation tasks

## Prerequisites

You need an **Apify API token**. You can create a free account on Apify and generate your API key in the dashboard. [Get a Free API key here](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/api).

Enter the key in the *Apify Token* field in all components that require the key.

## Example flow

This example flow demonstrates the use of multiple Apify Actors to complete a comprehensive web scraping task. The flow includes a Google Search Results Scraper Actor that extracts search results from Google and a TikTok Data Extractor Actor that gathers data from TikTok. Initially, the agent collects social media links related to an entity from Google. It then utilizes the TikTok Data Extractor to retrieve data and videos from the corresponding TikTok profile.
